Practice Questions

1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

2. What are the three Boolean operators?

3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).

4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?

(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)

5. What are the six comparison operators?

6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?

7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.

8. Identify the three blocks in this code:

spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')
    else:
        print('ham')
    print('spam')
print('spam')

9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

10. What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?

11. What is the difference between break and continue?

12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?

13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?



ANSWERS

1. True and False are the Boolean data types. True: False are how they are written.

2.
and,or,not

3.
True and True is True.

True and False is False.

False and True is False.

False and False is False.

True or True is True.

True or False is True.

False or True is True.

False or False is False.

not True is False.

not False is True.

4.
False
False
True
False
False
True

5.
>,<,>=,<=,==,!=

6.
= simply assigns the right value to the left variable.
== on the other handcomapres value and evealuates to True,False.

7.
A condition is used  in a flow control statement. It also controls the flow of code based on Boolean values.

8.
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')
    else:
        print('ham')
    print('spam')
    
if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')
        
else:
        print('ham')
        
        

9.
if spam == 1:
    print('Hello')
elif spam == 2:
    print('Howdy')
else:
    print('Greetings!')
    
10.
ctrl+C

11.
The break wil move out of a loop if a condition is met, continue on the other hand just skips the current condition and return to the begining of the loop.

12.

The range(10) call ranges from 0 up to 10, range(0, 10) tells the loop to start at 0, and range(0, 10, 1) tells the loop to increase the variable by 1 on each iteration.


13.
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
    
    
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
    
14.
spam.bacon()
